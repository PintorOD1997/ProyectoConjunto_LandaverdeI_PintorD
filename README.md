Financial Processes Simulation assignment final project

This project was meant to obtain random variables from any database, add them to a process, evaluate them and simulate them in order for us to reach an evaluation of said process. In this specific study case, we obtained the weather patterns of Seattle, WA, from 2008 to 2015, with the goal of setting up an imaginary carwash service in said city, with the premise of offering a free restitution carwash in case the previous paid carwash was spoiled due to rain. The purpose of the simulation was to obtain the probabilty of rain on a given day and month, so we could analyse if it was worth due to said probabilty being under 50%.
This project was presented on a Python Jupyter notebook, with the introduction, code and results within said notebook.
